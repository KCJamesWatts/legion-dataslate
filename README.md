# Legions Dataslate

Legions Dataslate, is an application used to track your collection, build armies, organise your games, record your battle history and plan tournaments.  The project is build using React.

This project is based off, JWTC2200's amazing Legion Builder app [[JWTC2200/legionbuilder](https://github.com/JWTC2200/legionbuilder)], this is a personal project intended for my own use, mostly as a learning exercise to see if I could recreate and extend it for my own uses.
